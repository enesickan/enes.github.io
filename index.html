                Hi, I am Enes İÇKAN. I was born in Çorum in August 2002. I studied and lived here until I was 18. After completing my high school education at Çorum Anatolian High School, I enrolled in AYBU Computer Engineering department and I am currently studying here. I try to improve myself and learn new things throughout my education. In general, my hobbies are watching movies, driving, playing video games, and doing sports. Due to my profession, I am interested in technological developments and advancements.
